# COMP307-assignment2

Neural and Evolutionary Learning

The goal of this assignment is to help you understand the basic concepts and algorithms of neural and
evolutionary learning, use these algorithms to perform regression and classification tasks, and analyse the
results to draw some conclusions.

## Part 1
New training set and test set file can be found in the iris.pat file for use with the BPNN package

## Part 2
Tode for part 2 is found in the "part2" directory, written in Python using the GPLearn package.

In order to run the program, ensure there is a directory called "data" containing the text file "regression.txt".

From the terminal simply run `python GeneticProg.py`

## Part 3
