# COMP307-assignment2

Neural and Evolutionary Learning

The goal of this assignment is to help you understand the basic concepts and algorithms of neural and
evolutionary learning, use these algorithms to perform regression and classification tasks, and analyse the
results to draw some conclusions.

## Part 1
New training set and test set file can be found in the iris.pat file for use with the BPNN package

## Part 2
Code for part 2 is found in the "part2" directory, written in Python using the GPLearn package.

In order to run the program, ensure there is a directory called "data" containing the text file "regression.txt".

From the terminal simply run `python GeneticProg.py`

## Part 3
Code for part 3 is found in the "part3" directory written in Python using the GPLearn package.

When running the program, please ensure that either the full dataset of "_breast-cancer-wisconsin.data_" is in the subdirectory "/data".

The program will also take in a training and test set in a _.txt_ format if specified.

In order to run the program run `python GeneticClass.py` or if you are specifying a training and test set use the following
`python GeneticClass.py trainingset.txt testset.txt`
